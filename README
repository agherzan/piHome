This is a metadata repository for home automation project based on meta-raspberrypi.

In order to start a fresh build just invoke the startBuild.sh script by typing
in the command line: ". ./startBuild.sh".

The script will take the build directory name as a parameter, if not will create
a new one containing the current timestamp (for example: rpi-build-yyyy-mm-dd).

The bblayers and local configuration file samples will be copied to the conf
directory for the build. The bblayers will be also modified with the correct paths.

The last step will be to invoke bitbake for the rpi-home-image.
