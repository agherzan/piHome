This is a metadata repository for a home automation / home security project 
based on meta-raspberrypi layer. The raspberrypi with the waveshare 7inch HDMI
capacitive display is used. For communication the NRF24L01+ modules are used,
making possible to pair the raspberrypi (master) with some ATMega328P 
microcontrollers that have the sensors on GPIO. Communication with the NRF24L01+
modules is done via SPI bus with the RF24/RF24Network/RF24Mesh libraries from
https://tmrh20.github.io/RF24/.
The master node (raspberrypi) can also have some wired sensors attached. The
interface with these sensors is done via GPIO by using the wiringPi library.
The intention is that this project uses some Qt5 interface for linking all the
parts together.


In order to start a fresh build after cloning the repository just invoke the
startBuild.sh script by typing in the command line:

". ./startBuild.sh" or "source ./startBuild.sh"


The script will take the build directory name as a parameter, if not will create
a new one containing the current timestamp one directory above the piHome layer.
For example: rpi-build-yyyy-mm-dd.


The bblayers and local configuration file samples will be copied to the conf
directory for the build new build. The bblayers will be also modified with
the correct paths.


The last step will be to invoke bitbake for the rpi-home-image.


The last two steps will be executed if there is no build directory specified. In
the other case no configuration file will be copied, nor the bitbake command on
the rpi-home-image will be executed. Script considers the user wants to initialize
the build environment in an older build directory and no further configuration will
be done.
